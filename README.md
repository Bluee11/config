This page is where I store my config files so that I can easily redownload them and set whatever system I am on to be how I want it. Several of the config files are copied from places such as reddit or other people's github repositories, and modified so that they fit my setup, and/or so that I can see if I understand what each line does.

A secondary goal of this repository is for me to learn more about Git/hub, and Linux in general.
